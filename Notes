1. install npm install @material-ui/core
2. paddding uses inside a container and margin outside a containrer.
3. goto https://disease.sh/docs/ for API calling for dynamic countries.
4. then use dynamic countries in dropdown menu in app.js
https://disease.sh/docs/#/COVID-19%3A%20Worldometers/get_v3_covid_19_countries

API : https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries


We created drop down and render countries dynamically till
1:22:45 time on video.


So, when we slect any country, it should be selected and show on drop down, there must be listner, and add onclick event


# how to sort lists by cases number ?
create new component Table.js file and create logic there..

then for sorting by cases , create utils.js

now, create LineGraph.js , react chart js library.
npm install --save chart.js react-chartjs-2


Now, install numeral




Now, create new file for Infobox
using wireframes, a complete divided into left and right container
total - 4 container divided.

.app__left {
  flex: 0.9;
}

it means left container will take 90 % of flex used in window.

Actually, after doing dynamic changes, for cases and total .
We observe that on loading, it was not loading data, only after slecting and moving back to worldwide then only its showin.
for that  we use useeffect() 

we can use several useEffect().


and then create LineGraph on right container .

Create graph Map.js
and install npm install react-leaflet


Need : When I click on any country , it should move to selected country ?
code in App.js ----> line no 68, 69

# Now, thereafter, we want to highlight red circle on selected country over map. how to do ?
So. I want function in Map.js who loop thorugh countries and draw circle on the screen.
so, do changes in App.js  where we have called MAp.
